4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I believe that the VGG model did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. It correctly classified the breed of Dog_01.jgp. It classified the Turtle.jpg as a terrapin. It classified Phone_01.jpg (which was an iPhone) to be a laptop, which was the closest out of the three models. The others classified the iPhone as a envelope and as a cleaver. It classifed Dog_02.jpg as a chihuahua which is incorrect but I can see how it would choose that breed based on the photo.
